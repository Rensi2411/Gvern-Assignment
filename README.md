# Dynamic Form

`Dynamic Form` is a reusable React component for creating customizable forms. It supports various data types such as text, number, date, time, phone, URL, and range. The component allows users to add new form fields dynamically and perform validation on input fields.

## Features

- Multiple data types: The component supports different input types including text, number, date, time, phone, URL, and range.
- Dynamic field addition: Users can add new form fields with different data types, names, and values.
- Input validation: Form fields are validated based on their data type to ensure data integrity.
- Reusable: The component can be easily integrated into other projects as a reusable form.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The application uses React functional components and hooks (`useState` and `useEffect`) for managing state and side effects.

- **CSS**: Cascading Style Sheets are used to style the components and improve the overall user experience. CSS files are imported into the components for styling.

- **Fetch API**: The Fetch API is a native JavaScript interface for making HTTP requests. It is used to fetch data from the server and submit data from forms.

- **Component-based Architecture**: The project follows a component-based architecture, separating different functionalities into individual components (`FormComponent` and `DisplayDataComponent`) for modularity and maintainability.

- **Local Server**: The application fetches and submits data to a local server running on `http://localhost:3001/formData`. The server is expected to be running separately and serving data to the application.

- **Dynamic Form Fields**: The `FormComponent` allows users to dynamically add new form fields based on selected data types (e.g., `text`, `tel`, `website`, `date`, `time`, `range`).

By leveraging these technologies, the application provides a robust and interactive experience for handling and displaying data.
